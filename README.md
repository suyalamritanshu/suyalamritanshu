## 💫 About Me

I’m a **Software Engineer with ~2 years of experience** building **scalable, performance-driven frontend applications**, primarily using **Angular, React, and TypeScript**.

I’ve worked on **enterprise-grade products used by millions of users**, where I focused on:
- Clean, reusable component architecture  
- Performance optimization (change detection, lazy loading)  
- Building maintainable UI workflows in collaboration with backend and product teams  

I enjoy solving problems at the **UI architecture and system interaction level**, and I care deeply about writing clean, production-ready code.
